                             I'm still working hard to learn from it. because I want to learn to draw,
                              I will find a way to fully memorize the techniques
                              of how to draw and sketch and as an art lover I just make it a hobby when I have nothing to do
                              I admire my sister and my cousins ​​for being talented and good at making realistic drawings.
                            
                              I love creating art that captures the beauty and complexity of the world around us. Whether I'm sketching ,
                               drawing a portrait, or creating a abstract piece, I strive to bring a unique perspective
                               and a sense of energy to my simple art. I'm also passionate about sharing my love of art 
                               in children who loves art. and I love seeing the joy and excitement that art 
                               can bring to people's lives. </h2>

                <h2>July 20, 2021 its COVID19 day</h2>
                <h2>This is my first experience in making realistic drawing is when one day my cousin called me to help her because someone was making her to do it or someone called it it a Commision and she will be paid she accepted so that she can help and earn money, so that she called me to help her because she know that I love art and I am willing to learn and learn something about art and also she knew that I was persistent in learning drawing, sketching and others.
                     she is the one who really knows how to make realistic drawings and I went in her house and I looked at her on how to do it and she taught me, I was the one who started to draw using the grid and she was the one who finished from sharpening and putting charcoals and everything and I helped so that I started to learn and because i just wanted to learn everything I'll go to her everyday 
                     so that she can teach me to draw and the steps on how to begin. So until now I've been rehearsing myself so I can learn more on to make realistic drawings</h2>
